This fun project uses a PIR sensor located in the eye socket of the skull to trigger a servo motor connected to the skulls jaw. Whenever someone comes into view of the sensor, the jaw starts its spooky, erratic movements. Mounted on the wall, the skull is guaranteed to scare the living daylights out of unsuspecting visitors!
